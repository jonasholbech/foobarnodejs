The clove and banana aromas common to German hefeweizens are inappropriate.  Hop aroma may be low to moderate, and can have either a citrusy American or a spicy or floral noble hop character.  Slight crisp sharpness is optional.  No diacetyl.",
        "appearance": "Usually pale yellow to gold.  Clarity may range from brilliant to hazy with yeast approximating the German hefeweizen style of beer.  Big, long-lasting white head.",
        "flavor": "Light to moderately strong grainy wheat or rye flavor, which can linger into the finish.  Rye versions are richer and spicier than wheat.  May have a moderate malty sweetness or finish quite dry.  Low to moderate hop bitterness, which sometimes lasts into the finish.  Low to moderate hop flavor (citrusy American or spicy/floral noble).  Esters can be moderate to none, but should not take on a German Weizen character (banana).  No clove phenols, although a light spiciness from wheat or rye is acceptable.  May have a slightly crisp or sharp finish.  No diacetyl.",

Many versions are dry hopped and can have an additional grassy aroma, although this is not required.  Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background, but should be at a lower level than in English examples.  Fruitiness, either from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable.  Some alcohol may be noted.",
        "appearance": "Color ranges from medium gold to medium reddish copper; some versions can have an orange-ish tint.  Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy.  Good head stand with white to off-white color should persist.",

Medium-high to very high hop bitterness, although the malt backbone will support the strong hop character and provide the best balance.  Malt flavor should be low to medium, and is generally clean and malty sweet although some caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable at low levels. No diacetyl.  Low fruitiness is acceptable but not required.  The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh.  Medium-dry to dry finish.  Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions.  Oak is inappropriate in this style.  May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.",
        "mouthfeel": "Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence of malt sweetness.  Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.  Body is generally less than in English counterparts.",
